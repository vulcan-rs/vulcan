# Vulcan

Vulcan is router / firewall software written in plain Rust and implements various network protocols like:

- BOOTP, the Bootstrap Protocol - [Link](bootp/README.md)
- DHCP, the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - [Link](dhcp/README.md)
- RAVD, Router Advertisements - [Link](radvd/README.md)

Currently the routing and firewalling is not handled by Vulcan it self.

## CLI

Coming soon.
